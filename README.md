README: Open World Forest Adventure
Welcome to the Open World Forest Adventure project in Unity! This README file provides an overview of the project setup, features, and instructions on how to toggle between rain and snow effects in the scene.
Project Overview
This project simulates a serene open-world forest environment complete with a tranquil lake and a cozy cabin. Users can explore this environment using a simple First-Person Controller (FPC) and interact with various elements. The scene includes dynamic weather effects such as rain and snow, which can be toggled on and off to enhance the immersive experience.
Features-
Forest Environment:
Detailed 3D forest with vegetation, trees, and foliage.
Realistic lake with reflective water surface.
Cabin modeled with interior and exterior details.
First-Person Controller (FPC):
Basic navigation using arrow keys to move and explore the environment.
Allows interaction with objects and surroundings.
Visual Enhancements:
Global post-processing effects:
Bloom effect for realistic lighting and glowing visuals.
Color grading to enhance mood and atmosphere.
Dynamic Weather System:
Toggleable rain and snow effects:
Rain and snow particles adjust dynamically based on player movement.
Weather effects follow the player's camera position for realistic simulation.
